[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chipset95/WearDialer.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/chipset95/WearDialer)

Dial a number on the watch and place a call from your phone. No need to take out the phone from pocket!

The app is still in beta, so feel free to fork, put an issue or send a pull request.

Join the [Google+ community](https://plus.google.com/communities/102020203714396804737) to become a beta tester.

P.S. Please help in travis CI testing of the app. I'm unable to setup an android wear image on travis.
