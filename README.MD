# Wear Dialer
[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chipset95/WearDialer.svg?branch=development)](https://travis-ci.org/chipset95/WearDialer)

Dial a number on the watch and place a call from your phone. No need to take out the phone from pocket!

THIS IS THE DEVELOPMENT BRANCH, THE APP MAY OR MAY NOT BE STABLE. For stable version, have a look at the master branch.

## Permissions

- `android.permission.CALL_PHONE` to place to call
- `android.permission.INTERNET` for crash analysis

## Contribution

The app is still in beta, so feel free to fork, put an issue or send a pull request on the development branch.
Pull requests on master will not be accepted.

P.S. Please help in travis CI testing of the app. I'm unable to setup an android wear image on travis.
